# hackerone2threadfix
This script enables a quick, automatic conversion from HackerOne .csv export to a compatible format for upload to ThreadFix.

HackerOne offers the ability to quickly export reports from a program via .csv file. This script takes the .csv file downloaded from HackerOne and converts it to a format that can be ingested by ThreadFix via their SSVL Converter tool.

## Usage
For all options and instructions run: `python hackerone2threadfix.py -h`

## Report Body
The full details of a HackerOne report can always be viewed on HackerOne via the report URL. If you wish to import the body of the report (containing steps to reproduce, etc.) into ThreadFix, you can do so with the following options:

1. manually copy-paste the report body from HackerOne into the "LongDescription" field of the .csv file
2. Uncomment the API portion of the Python script, make sure your HackerOne API key is properly set, and re-run the script
